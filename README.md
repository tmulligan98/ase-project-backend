## Setup and Installation

### Python

We will use `python 3.8`, all of the required dependencies are included in `requirements.txt`.
Please use an environment manager (conda).
To install all dependencies, `pip install -r requirements.dev.txt`.

**When we run into problems that require new libraries, be sure to add them to `requirements.txt`!!!**

### External Requirements

### Env Variables
For now, we will use a preset public and private key for accessing external APIs... Please don't commit them!
The keys will be included in a `.env` file, which will be read using Pydantics `BaseSettings` class. More on this later...

### Local Dev Environment
I don't know how to use Black Linter with anything else other than VSCode, if you can set it up, go ahead.
Here's how to do it with VSCode.
```
    "python.formatting.provider": "black",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "python.linting.enabled": true,
```
Include this in your `.vscode/settings.json`
If you use pycharm then follow this [guide](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/editor_integration.html#pycharm-intellij-idea).

As a rule: never commit your local IDE setting to this repository.


### Environment Variables
**What are these?**
These are variables used througout our system. For example, an access key to a given API
We will use a `.env` file to store out env variables. This file is read using the Pydantic `BaseSettings` class, which will contain secrete access keys for external APIs, such as TomTom. Any local environment values will be overwritten by those in the `.env` file.
For security reasons, the `.env` file is excluded from git.

For our application to work, you will need to create a `.env` file with the following environment variable(s):

    - TOM_TOM_ACCESS_Key


### Pre-commit

We have a pre-commit configuration that you can use to ensure that your code is formatted properly and passes flake8 (lint) checks before it is even committed. In order to set up pre-commit you need to install it locally, check instructions [here](https://pre-commit.com/#intro).

### FastAPI

We use [Fast API](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) as a server framework to serve requests, it is recommended to familiarize yourself with it before you dive into the code. Things will make more sense this way ðŸ™‚.

As a type validation, Fast API uses the [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) library - which allows us to validate inputs and outputs and provide stricter typing that the python standard.

### Start the application

In order to start the app, and once your environment is activated and ready, simply run: `uvicorn backend.main:app --reload`. Note that you will need to have installed the `uvicorn` server. You can pass in other parameters here to control the port and other configurations (the default port is 8000). Using the `--reload` flag will automatically reload the server after changes to the code are made.

You can also run the app inside vscode to allow for interactive debugging by running the command in debugging mode.

Once the app is started you should see the url where it is served as:
`Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000`

If you then navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` you will be able to see all the routes that the API offers.

### Using Docker

We use Docker when deploying the application in order to maintain a clean and scalable environment. Docker

Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) locally in order to be able to build and run the Docker file and container.

To run it make sure you have docker desktop running in your local machine and after creating the virtual environment and installing all the updated dependencies from requirements.txt use the following commands to setup the containers:

**Locally**
docker-compose --env-file ./.env up --build
- Make sure you have a file called env.list containing the required env variables in the same directory.
- It will take some time to load it up
- After you can see the backend app starting on 0.0.0.0:8000/
and to validate if the instance is connected to database, run:-
docker exec -it postgresql_db bash,
and you will be entered in a postgresql shell.

docker-compose down --volumes 
to reset


## Running Tests and Code Quality

In order to run the test suite you can call `pytest` or `python -m unittest discover test` from the main directory.

New functionalities need to be unit tested to insure high coverage and reproducibility.

Test coverage is measured using `pytest-cov` and reported on any new MR.

## Contributing
Please make your own branch!
Contribution must be done via Pull Requests and merge with the `main` branch. This allows us to do code review, but also run unit tests and linting checks on the code itself.

Commit messages must try to follow the [conventional commits message format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/).
